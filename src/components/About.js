        Hello! I'm Adam Marey, a devoted software engineer with a rich
        background in computer science. With over two years in web application
        and backend architecture design, I also wear the hat of a web mentor,
        eager to guide aspiring software engineers to greatness. Beyond codes
        and algorithms, I unwind by hitting the gym and experimenting with
        delightful recipes in the kitchen. Let's connect, explore my portfolio,
        and feel free to reach out anytime to talk tech, workouts, or the
        perfect dish to cook!
